# Accessibility (a11y) Guidelines for React Component Library

## Introduction

This document outlines best practices for ensuring accessibility in our React component library. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to create an inclusive and accessible user experience, compliant with WCAG 2.1 standards.

## Principles of Accessible Design

### Perceivable
- **Text Alternatives:** Provide alt text for images. Example: `<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">`.
- **Time-based Media:** Offer alternatives for video and audio content, like captions or transcripts.

### Operable
- **Keyboard Accessible:** All functionality must be accessible via a keyboard. For instance, ensure dropdown menus can be navigated with arrow keys.
- **Enough Time:** Provide sufficient time for users to read and use content.

### Understandable
- **Readable Text:** Use clear fonts and text colors that contrast well with the background.
- **Predictable Navigation:** Maintain consistent navigation across the website.

### Robust
- **Compatibility:** Ensure content is compatible with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

## React Specific Guidelines

### Semantic HTML
- Use semantic HTML elements to reinforce the meaning of the content. Example: `<button>` for clickable buttons instead of `<div>` or `<span>`.

### ARIA Roles
- When native HTML cannot convey the component's role, use ARIA roles. Example: `role="navigation"` for a custom navigation component.

### Keyboard Navigation
- Ensure interactive elements like buttons, links, and form controls are accessible using the keyboard.

### Focus Management
- Manage focus in complex components like modals. When a modal opens, move the focus to the modal and trap it there until the modal is closed.

## Using Tailwind for Accessibility

### Responsive Design
- Use responsive classes to ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes. Example: `md:text-lg` for larger text on medium-sized screens.

### Color Contrast
- Ensure text and interactive elements have a high contrast ratio with their backgrounds for readability.

### Screen Reader Utilities
- Use Tailwind classes like `sr-only` to hide visual elements that should be accessible only to screen readers.

## Leveraging Storybook for a11y Testing

### a11y Addon
- Utilize the Storybook a11y addon to perform real-time accessibility checks on components.

### Custom Stories
- Create stories in Storybook focusing on keyboard navigation and screen reader functionality.

### Documentation
- Provide clear documentation on how to use components accessibly, including props and keyboard interactions.

## HeadlessUI and Accessibility

### Leveraging HeadlessUI
- Utilize HeadlessUI components which come with built-in accessibility features, ensuring custom styles do not compromise accessibility.

### Customization
- When extending HeadlessUI components, ensure that accessibility attributes like `aria-*` are preserved.

## Unit Testing for Accessibility

### Automated Testing
- Use tools like Jest and axe-core for automated a11y tests. Example: Write tests to check if components have appropriate ARIA attributes.

### Manual Testing
- Regularly perform manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation to catch issues that automated tests may miss.
